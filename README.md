# Foucault Pendulum

The Foucault pendulum, named after the French physicist [LÃ©on Foucault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A9on_Foucault), is a long spherical pendulum with a large mass at the lower end. This pendulum is so large that the earth's rotation influences its trajectory. By this change of the trajectory it can be proved that the earth rotates.
